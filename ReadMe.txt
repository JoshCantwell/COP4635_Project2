The purpose of this program is to make an application that will communicate via server client
connection to others connected to the app, the functionality supported so far in the program
are as follows. Register User, User login, User subscribe and unsubscribe to location, Show
locations subscribed to, and change password.

This code has some problems that i couldnt resolve, could be how my server client architecture
communicates, but nothing program breaking. sometime it wont allow logging in for some reason,
but since the problem doesnt occur everytime it was hard to find and fix

also when the selection prompt doesnt show up after completing input, pressing enter should make it appear. this also doesnt happen everytime so its hard to find and fix as well.
